# Algorithmic-Skeleton-Trading-Templates
Template programming pattern (Skeleton) to be used to build fully customizable trading strategies with configurable open-close trade conditions.

These are fully functional, complete Expert Advisors. You just need to modify/enlarge a few functions - those that specify under which conditions should the buy/sell positions be opened. Here you can add your own trading logic, indicators, position-open strategies.

## 1. Introduction
<strong>Motivation. </strong> <p>I have a new trading strategy idea every day, and I want to implement on the fly as soon as possible. This is why I created these <em>"skeleton" trading bots</em>. These templates just require you to fill in the position-open functions with your own personal strategies. </p>
